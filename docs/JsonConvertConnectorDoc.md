## About the connector
Convert the output of many commands and file-types to structured objects using the open-source JSON Convert (JC) library. The JC project details can be found at https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc
<p>This document provides information about the JC - Parse Command Output Connector, which facilitates automated interactions, with a JC - Parse Command Output server using FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks. Add the JC - Parse Command Output Connector as a step in FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks and perform automated operations with JC - Parse Command Output.</p>
